# GCal API Event Creator

Python loop to create Google Calendar events based on a rota dictionary.
Connection to GCal authorised through the Google Developer [API Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python) guide.

Details of rota held in rota.json as to not dox my friend. 

Not accustomed to Python so it probably doesn't follow convention but it served its purpose as a quick-fix.
